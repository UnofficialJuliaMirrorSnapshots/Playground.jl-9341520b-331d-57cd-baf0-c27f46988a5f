## Installation ##
### With Julia ###
The ideal way to install playground is via the registered julia package. However, this requires that you already have julia installed on your system.

Installing the julia package
```julia
julia> Pkg.add("Playground")
```

NOTE: As of v0.0.6 you will need to run
```julia
julia> ENV["PLAYGROUND_INSTALL"] = true
```
prior to running `Pkg.add` or `Pkg.build` if you'd like the compiled playground executable to be installed into the common `~/.playground/bin/` path.

Running the playground script
```shell
~/.playground/bin/playground
```

Recommended: add the playground bin directory to your path
by editing your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, ~/.tcshrc, etc.
```shell
echo "PATH=~/.playground/bin/:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```
This will make the playground script and all managed julia versions easily accessible.

Currently, some of the dependencies in Playground.jl such as Options.jl and ArgParse.jl throw deprecation warnings. If you'd like to ignore these warnings until new versions of these packages are release just add `--depwarn=no` to the shebang in `~/.playground/bin/playground`. If you're running linux you'll need to change this line to `#!/usr/bin/julia --depwarn=no` as `env` in linux can only take 1 argument otherwise the process will stall.

### Without Julia ###
As of v0.0.6 and up binary releases of playground are available for download [here](https://github.com/Rory-Finnegan/Playground.jl/releases), which will allow you to run playground without having an existing julia install.

Steps:

1. Download the tar.gz file for your platform into your desired install location (ie: `~/bin`)
1. Go to that directory (`cd ~/bin`)
1. Extract the build (`tar -xvzf ~/bin/playground-osx.tar.gz`)
1. `cd playground && ./INSTALL.sh`
1. Create an alias that sets the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and calls the script. This should be placed in your shell rc file, so if your default shell is bash then you'd add `alias playground="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/bin/playground ~/bin/playground/playground"` to your `~/.bashrc` file.

NOTE: This alias hack with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is only necessary due to an issue in the binaries created with [BuildExecutable.jl](https://github.com/dhoegh/BuildExecutable.jl). In future releases it should only be necessary for `~/bin/playground` to be on your search path (ie: in your `PATH` variable).

### Making Binary Executables

If you'd like to build you own playground binary executables you'll have a few more steps.
First, add `BuildExecutable`

```julia
julia> Pkg.add("BuildExecutable")
```

If you're on linux you may want to install the latest master release which will handle installing `patchelf` for you.

```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/dhoegh/BuildExecutable.jl")
```
In order to tell the Playground.jl build script to create a binary executable you'll need to run
```julia
julia> ENV["PLAYGROUND_BIN_EXEC"] = true
```
prior to calling `Pkg.build("Playground")`.

## Usage (subcommands)##
### install (Unix only) ###
To install a binary julia version from http://julialang.org/downloads/.
```shell
# playground install download <version> --labels label1 label2
playground install download 0.3 --labels julia-0.3
```

To make an existing build available to playgrounds.
```shell
# playground install link <path> --labels label1 label2
playground install link /path/to/julia/binary --labels julia-src
```

**[TODO]** To build and install a julia version from source.
```shell
playground install build --url https://github.com/MyUser/julia.git --rev dev --labels julia-wip
```
This is less of a priority as most individuals can just manual build from source and use `playground install link` to make their build available. Similarly, this particular subcommand will be more brittle as it depends on the success of the julia build process.

NOTE: Along with the provided labels, all install cmds will automatically create symlinks for the full version and commit eg: `julia-0.3.11` and `julia-128797f`.


### create ###
To create a new playground using your existing julia install in your current working directory.
```shell
playground create
```

This will automatically create a `.playground` folder (default specified in `~/.playground/config.yml`)

To create a new playground in a specific directory.
```shell
playground create /path/of/new/playground
```

Alternatively, you can name your playgrounds to make them available without remembering where they're stored.
```shell
playground create --name research-playground
```

NOTE: If both a directory and a `--name` are supplied the playground will be created in the provided directory and linked to `~/.playground/share/<name>`. Otherwise, the playground will be created directly in `~/.playground/share/<name>`.

To create a playground with a default julia-version. The julia version supplied must already be installed with methods listed above.
```shell
playground create /path/of/new/playground --name nightly-playground --julia-version julia-nightly
```

To create a new playground with pre-existing requirements using REQUIRE or DECLARE files.
```shell
playground create --requirements /path/to/REQUIRE/or/DECLARE/file
```

If the basename of the file is not `REQUIRE` or `DECLARE` you can still specify the requirement type.
```shell
playground create --requirements /path/to/requirements/file --req-type DECLARE
```

If using DECLARE files you should make sure that `DeclarativePackages.jl` is already installed.


### activate ###
To activate a given playground simply run.
```shell
playground activate /path/to/your/playground
```
or
```shell
playground activate --name myproject
```

NOTE: On Unix systems, activate will try and open a new shell using you SHELL environment variable and a modified copy of your `~/.<shell>rc` file. Otherwise, it will fall back to using `sh -i`.


### list ###
To see what install julia-versions and playgrounds (named ones) are available.
```shell
playground list
```


### clear ###
If you've removed some a source julia-version or have deleted playground folders and would like playground to clean up any broken symlinks.
```shell
playground clean
```

### rm ###
If you'd like to remove a julia-version or playground you can run.
```shell
playground rm [playground-name|julia-version] --dir /path/to/playgrounds
```
which will delete the specified playground or julia-version and make sure that all related links have been cleaned up.
**Warning**: Deleting julia versions may break playgrounds that depend on that version. If this occurs you can either manually recreate the julia symlink with `ln -s ~/.playground/bin/<julia-version> /path/to/playground/bin/julia` or better yet recreate the playground.


## Configuration ##
For the most part, Playground.jl provide its virtualized environments by simply manipulating environment variables and symlinks to julia binaries/playgrounds. However, in order to do this it needs to create its own folder for managing these symlinks. By default Playground.jl creates its own config folder in `~/.playground`. This folder is structured as follows.
```
|-- .playground/
    |-- config.yml
    |-- bin/
        |-- playground
        |-- julia
        |-- julia-stable
        |-- julia-nightly
        |-- julia-0.3
        |-- julia-0.4
        ...
    |-- share/
        |-- myproject
        |-- testing
        |-- research
    |-- src/
        |-- julia-038-osx10
            ...
    |-- tmp/
        |-- julia-0.3.8-osx10.7+.dmg
```

* bin: contains all the symlinks to installed julia versions (and also the playground script itself)
* share: contains all the named playgrounds or links to named playgrounds.
* src: contains the extracted binary builds and cloned julia repos.
* tmp: just contains the raw julia binary downloads


### config.yml ###
The config.yml file provides a mechanism for configuring default behaviour. This file is setup during installation.
```
---
# This is just default location to store a new playground.
# This is used by create and activate if no --name or --path.
default_playground_path: .playground

# Default shell prompt when you activate a playground.
default_prompt: "\\e[0;35m\\u@\\h:\\W (playground)> \\e[m"

# Default git settings when using install build
default_git_address: "https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git"
default_git_revision: master

# Allows you to isolate shell and julia history to each playground.
isolated_shell_history: true
isolated_julia_history: true
```


## TODOs ##
* More thorough test coverage
* Full windows support including `install`
* `install build` support.
